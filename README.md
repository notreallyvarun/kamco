🛠️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Frontend  
Python: Backend  
MongoDB: Database
Git: Version Control

💻 Usage Guide
Once both the backend and frontend servers are successfully running:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

The application will automatically redirect you to the dedicated login page (/login).

Login as a Registered User: Use your registered credentials in the login form to authenticate.

Access Dashboard & Fetch Email: Upon successful authentication, you will be seamlessly redirected to the secure dashboard (/dashboard), where you can view your profile and verify your associated email address.

Language Switching: Utilize the intuitive language toggle to effortlessly switch between English and Arabic.
